                        <p>Hello, my name is James Prine. I grew up with computers most of my life, I was born in 1987, the year Cisco shipped its first router. 1999 was the first year that I touched Adobe products called Macromedia, such as Dreamweaver, Flash, Photo Impact, Fireworks and many more.</p>
                        <p>I plan to use my knowledge of web development to further my education for two years associate degree in front-end web development. After my two years of education, I plan to go on and start working with a team of colleagues.</p>
                        <p>In my spare time I enjoy playing music. I have been playing guitar for over twenty years, and just bought a Ukulele which I love. I also spend a lot of time outside with my English bulldog, Pickles.</p>

                        <h3>Web Design</h3>
                        <p>Well designed websites produce more than just aesthetics. They appeal to users and aid people in understanding the product, company, and branding. Every element of your site needs to work towards an established goal.</p>

                        <p>Successful pages strike stability between attractive content and elegant design. Web content needs to be brief, surrounded by whitespace and precise but scannable. I build standard compliant, SEO optimized, and multi-browser compatible sites.</p>
